# Weight Tracker
This is a personal weight tracker I wrote and programmed when I first learned C# and how to use WinForms. It was as personal project I worked on my sophomore year studing Computer Science. 

This application connects to an Oracle 11g Database on the local machine to store the weight data. It also has the ability to graph the weights where the date is the X-coordinate and the weights the Y-coordinate. The settings are stored in a text file where if the file does not exist it means the user is using the program for the first time. It asks for the user to entre a starting and goal weight. If ever the user enters a weight higher than the starting weight it will give a popup message to warn the user of weight gain. Also one for when the user enters a weight equal to, or less than, the goal weight as congratulations. 

Once the user closes out the program they will recieve a popup to show them that they have disconnected from the database.
